## Technical Foundation

I have a strong background in software engineering, Linux system administration, and research computing, with hands-on experience spanning Python, Docker, distributed systems, web development, and scientific data pipelines. Over the years, I have evolved from traditional systems and infrastructure roles into a developer who builds full-stack research platforms—from backend data ingestion and processing pipelines to interactive, browser-based visualisation tools.

## Current Work: Grant Lab, University of Edinburgh

At the University of Edinburgh, I am closely involved with the Seth Grant Lab (Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences / Genes to Cognition Programme), where I contribute to multiple long-term research initiatives related to human brain synaptome mapping. My work directly supports scientists by transforming raw microscopy and experimental data into structured, analysable formats, and by building tools that make complex datasets accessible to non-technical users.

## SynaptopathyDB: A Nature Publication

One of my key contributions is **SynaptopathyDB**, a publicly available research database published in *Nature Scientific Reports*.
