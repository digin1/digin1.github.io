I am a software engineer and computational scientist working at the University of Edinburgh, where my role sits at the intersection of scientific research, large-scale data processing, and modern web technologies. My work focuses on designing, building, and maintaining end-to-end computational systems that enable researchers to analyse, visualise, and interpret complex biological imaging and genomic data at scale.

## Technical Foundation

I have a strong background in software engineering, Linux system administration, and research computing, with hands-on experience spanning Python, Docker, distributed systems, web development, and scientific data pipelines. Over the years, I have evolved from traditional systems and infrastructure roles into a developer who builds full-stack research platforms—from backend data ingestion and processing pipelines to interactive, browser-based visualisation tools.

## Current Work: Grant Lab, University of Edinburgh

At the University of Edinburgh, I am closely involved with the Seth Grant Lab (Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences / Genes to Cognition Programme), where I contribute to multiple long-term research initiatives related to human brain synaptome mapping. My work directly supports scientists by transforming raw microscopy and experimental data into structured, analysable formats, and by building tools that make complex datasets accessible to non-technical users.

## SynaptopathyDB: A Nature Publication

One of my key contributions is **SynaptopathyDB**, a publicly available research database published in *Nature Scientific Reports*. I played a central role in developing the platform, including data integration, backend APIs, frontend visualisation, and deployment. The project brings together proteomic, genetic, and disease-association data to support research into synaptic disorders, and it represents a significant example of my ability to translate scientific requirements into robust, production-grade software.

## Large-Scale Microscopy Data

Beyond databases, I have extensive experience working with large-scale microscopy data, including Nikon ND2, Zeiss CZI, IMS, and high-resolution TIFF montages. I have designed and implemented conversion pipelines, stitching algorithms, metadata extraction tools, and GPU-accelerated workflows to handle datasets that can span tens of thousands of pixels or billions of data points. These pipelines are used in real research workflows and must balance accuracy, performance, and reproducibility.

## Custom Visualisation & Analysis Tools

I am the developer behind several custom visualisation and segmentation tools built using technologies such as Flask, Three.js, React, and Docker. These tools allow researchers to interactively explore massive imaging datasets, draw and edit ROIs, overlay analytical results, and export data in formats compatible with downstream tools such as ImageJ, MATLAB, and Napari. Performance, usability, and reliability are core design considerations in my work.

## Infrastructure & DevOps

On the infrastructure side, I have deep experience managing Linux servers, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes environments, distributed task queues, and research clusters. I regularly work with Dask, Celery, GPU-enabled containers, NAS storage systems, and CI/CD pipelines. My background in system administration allows me to design solutions that are not only functional, but also maintainable, secure, and cost-effective in a real institutional environment.

## Education & Recognition

I hold a **Master's degree in Cyber Security** from Nottingham Trent University, where I received the **Best Project Award**. This background strongly influences my approach to software development—I place a high emphasis on data protection, access control, reproducibility, and compliance, particularly when working with sensitive research data and public-facing platforms.

## What Sets Me Apart

What distinguishes my work is the ability to operate comfortably across domains: I can discuss scientific requirements with researchers, design scalable architectures, write production-ready code, and deploy and maintain systems in live environments. I enjoy solving hard, messy problems where data, computation, and usability intersect, and I take pride in building tools that genuinely improve how research is conducted.

## Looking Forward

I am passionate about creating robust, transparent, and reusable research software, and I am particularly motivated by projects that have real scientific and societal impact. My long-term goal is to continue contributing to high-impact research through technology—building platforms and tools that help scientists ask better questions and discover meaningful answers.
