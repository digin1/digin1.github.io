## Project Overview
Boot Factory is an e-commerce web application developed as coursework using the ASP.NET MVC framework and C#. The project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications from the ground up. The platform allows users to browse a catalogue of footwear products, add items to their shopping basket, and proceed through a complete checkout process.

## Technical Stack
* **Backend**: C# with ASP.NET MVC framework
* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap for responsive design
* **Database**: SQL Server for product data and user management
* **Authentication**: ASP.NET Identity for secure user login and registration
* **Version Control**: Git for source code management

## Key Features Implemented
* **User Authentication System**: Secure login, registration, and user profile management with email confirmation
* **Product Catalogue**: Categorized browsing with filtering and search functionality
* **Shopping Basket**: AJAX-powered add/remove functionality with real-time total calculation
* **Order Processing**: Complete checkout flow with address collection and order confirmation
* **Admin Dashboard**: Product management interface for adding, editing, and removing products
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes

## Development Challenges
The most significant challenges I encountered during development included implementing session management for the shopping basket functionality and ensuring proper validation of user input throughout the application. I overcame these by leveraging ASP.NET session state management and implementing robust model validation.

## What I Learned
This project significantly improved my understanding of:
* MVC architecture pattern and its practical implementation
* Entity Framework for database operations
* Authentication and authorization in web applications
* Frontend-backend integration using Razor views
* Form validation and security best practices
* User experience design for e-commerce platforms

## Conclusion
The Boot Factory project demonstrates my capability to develop a complete web application using modern technologies and patterns. Through this coursework, I gained valuable experience in building secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications that would transfer well to real-world e-commerce development.
