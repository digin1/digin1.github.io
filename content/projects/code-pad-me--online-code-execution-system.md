## 🚀 About the Project

**Code-Pad.me** is an online code execution web platform designed to help learners, educators, and developers write, share, and execute code effortlessly from any device—without the need to install a local compiler or development environment.

Whether you're coding from a desktop, tablet, or even a mobile browser, Code-Pad.me empowers users to share challenges, test code snippets, and learn collaboratively—all within a sleek, browser-based interface.

---

## 🧠 Inspiration

During the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning became a lifeline for education. However, coding education suffered due to setup issues—like incompatible compilers, platform dependencies, and device limitations (especially for iOS users).  
This inspired me to develop **Code-Pad.me**—a zero-setup, responsive, cloud-based code runner that works anywhere, anytime.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a **web-based code execution platform** supporting multiple programming languages.
- Eliminate setup barriers by offering **compiler-less code execution**.
- Enable users to **create and share coding challenges** for peer learning.
- Encourage coding collaboration with **shareable links & QR codes**.
- Ensure cross-platform access with a **responsive, mobile-first design**.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- 🖥️ **Multi-language Code Execution** (via Judge0 API)
- 🔒 **Secure, Containerized Execution** (Docker-based sandboxing)
- 📱 **Mobile & Desktop Friendly** (Responsive UI using Bootstrap 5)
- 📤 **Code Sharing with QR & Short URLs**
- 🎯 **Custom & Random Challenges** for continuous learning
- 📥 **Downloadable Code** with proper file extensions
- 🔢 **Code View Metrics** to track engagement
- 💬 **User Feedback Integration** during development

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The app uses a modern stack with continuous delivery pipelines:

- **Backend**: Python (Django)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, CodeMirror Editor
- **API**: Judge0 for secure multi-language code execution
- **CI/CD**: GitLab Runner, Docker
- **Database**: SQLite (Dev), PostgreSQL (Production)
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on Ubuntu VM

---

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

- ✅ **Unit & System Testing**: Validated core functionality, user interactions, and system behavior.
- 📈 **Performance Testing**: Tested with up to 1000 concurrent users using `httperf`.
- 📋 **User Feedback Surveys**: Guided feature additions like:
  - Dark mode (Planned)
  - Challenge system
  - QR code sharing
  - Code readability improvements via CodeMirror
