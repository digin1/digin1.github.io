title: "Hycel Asset Management System"
date: "2021-04-15"
summary: "The Hycel Asset Management System is an IoT-integrated hydrogen leakage detection infrastructure built for Deakin University that visualizes real-time sensor data on interactive Google Maps. Using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and BigData integration, the system displays color-coded map markers with detailed sensor information panels showing temperature, humidity, and system status. The project features custom SQL queries for efficient data retrieval, a responsive interface for cross-device monitoring, and a built-in comment system for team communication. This safety-critical system enables early detection of potential hydrogen leaks, enhancing facility safety protocols and creating a scalable platform for the university's expanding Hycel precinct."
