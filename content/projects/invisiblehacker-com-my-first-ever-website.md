summary: "Despite its intriguing name, the site focused on ethical programming resources, particularly C language tutorials and exercises. The project featured a responsive layout with a dark-themed UI inspired by early 2000s 'hacker aesthetics,' custom navigation, and categorized sections for programming content. This entirely hand-coded project established strong web development fundamentals and ignited a lasting passion for software development.

## Overview
InvisibleHacker.com was my first website created during college, marking the beginning of my journey in software development. Built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and static web design principles, this project sparked my long-term passion for building software and web applications. Despite its mysterious name, it was an ethical website focused on sharing programming resources, especially for C language learners.

## Project Description
InvisibleHacker.com was more than just a website — it was my personal gateway into the world of web development. I designed and developed every part of the site manually, using only basic tools and no frameworks.

### Features
- Fully responsive static layout
- Custom navigation menu with hover effects
- Categorized sections for Programming, Web Design, and Ethical Hacking content
- Curated collection of C programming examples and logic-building exercises
- Simple but effective UI inspired by early 2000s "hacker-style" themes (dark mode before it was cool!)
- Integration with social media icons using pure CSS techniques

### Content
I hosted tutorials and logic programs like:
- Sum and average of three numbers
- Distance calculation between two cities
- Identifying prime/Armstrong numbers
- Reverse and factorial logic
- Simple C-based calculator simulations

At the time, I didn't use any CMS, JS libraries, or third-party templates — just raw HTML and CSS. This project taught me fundamentals like layout design, styling, navigation systems, and the importance of user experience even in simple applications.

## Technologies Used
- HTML4/5
- CSS2/3
- Manual file linking and layout structuring
- No CMS or JavaScript frameworks — purely handcrafted code

## Key Learnings
- Developed strong foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Learned how to build static websites from scratch
- Practiced clear content organization and layout design
- Gained early insights into UX design and user navigation
- Sparked interest in ethical tech, education, and sharing knowledge
