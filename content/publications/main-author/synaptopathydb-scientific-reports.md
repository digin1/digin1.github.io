Synaptic dysfunction resulting from pathogenic variants in genes encoding synaptic proteins is a major contributor to brain and behavioural disorders, collectively termed synaptopathies. To facilitate research into the genetic basis and clinical manifestations of synaptopathy we have created SynaptopathyDB, an online resource that integrates data from 64 mammalian synapse proteomic studies and multiple genetic and phenotypic resources (<a href="https://www.synaptopathydb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.synaptopathyDB.org</a>). We identified a consensus set of 3,437 mammalian synapse proteins from presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments, which have wide application in genetic and omic studies. Mutations in 954 genes encoding 28% of the consensus synapse proteome were associated with 1,266 OMIM diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system. We present findings that underscore the pervasive role of synaptic gene variants in the phenotypes of neurological, psychiatric, developmental, and systemic disorders highlighting the significant burden they impose on individuals and healthcare systems. SynaptopathyDB is a versatile platform and discovery tool for understanding the role of synapse proteins and genetic variants in human disease phenotypes.
